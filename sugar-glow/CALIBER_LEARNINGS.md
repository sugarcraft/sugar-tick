# Caliber Learnings

Accumulated patterns and anti-patterns from development sessions.

- **[pattern:glow]** WidthHelper uses `mb_strwidth('UTF-8')` for all width calculations. Never use `strlen()` or `mb_strlen()` for visual width — they count code units, not visual columns. Full-width CJK characters return 2, combining marks return -1 (which collapses to 0 in truncation).
- **[pattern:glow]** FileWatcher::watch() is a Generator that runs indefinitely. Always consume it inside a loop with a termination condition or stream context cancellation — never `foreach` it directly outside a coroutine dispatcher or you will block forever.
- **[pattern:glow]** GlamourTheme::fromJson() and ::fromFile() both return a bare `new self()` on invalid input rather than throwing. Callers receive an empty theme silently. If validation is needed, check `$theme->chroma !== []` or inspect the returned values.
- **[pattern:glow]** GlamourTheme chroma keys are arbitrary strings (e.g., `emphasis`, `strong`, `code`) matched against token names emitted by the renderer. There is no fixed enumeration — resolve() returns `null` for unknown tokens rather than throwing.
