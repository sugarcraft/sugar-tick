Accumulated patterns and gotchas for this library.

## Parser table

The VT500 state machine transition table is generated in PHP at first
use as a 4096-byte string (15 states × 256 codes), packed one byte per
entry as `(action << 4) | nextState`. State and Action enums hold the
canonical numeric values; their order is load-bearing because the
transition table is keyed by `state.value << 8 | byte`. The build
function in `Transitions::build()` is a direct port of upstream
`charmbracelet/x/ansi/parser.GenerateTransitionTable` — keep them in
sync if upstream changes the table.

## ESC dispatch is separate from CSI dispatch

Two-byte ESC sequences (e.g. ESC D = IND, ESC 7 = DECSC) emit
`Handler::escDispatch($final, $intermediate)`, not `csiDispatch` or
`execute`. Downstream handlers translate ESC + 0x40-0x5F to the
equivalent C1 control if they want; the parser stays neutral.

## ESC \ (ST) emits a trailing escDispatch

When OSC/DCS/SOS/PM/APC are terminated by `ESC \` (ST in 7-bit form),
the parser dispatches the string sequence on the ESC, transitions to
Escape state, then dispatches the trailing `\` as `escDispatch(0x5C)`.
Most consumers ignore it. BEL and 8-bit ST (0x9C) terminators don't
have this trailing event.

## UTF-8 multi-byte handling

Lead bytes (0xC2-0xF4) transition to a synthetic `State::Utf8` and the
parser accumulates continuation bytes (0x80-0xBF) internally. The full
rune arrives at the handler as a single `printChar(string $rune)` call
— callers don't need to reassemble bytes themselves. An ASCII byte
arriving mid-rune drops the partial sequence and processes the byte
fresh from Ground.

## CSI default params surface as -1

`\x1b[;H` produces `params = [-1, -1]` (two slots, both default).
`\x1b[1;H` produces `[1, -1]`. Sentinel `-1` means "missing/default";
handlers downstream should resolve to spec-defined defaults
(`?: 1` for cursor moves, `?: 0` for SGR, etc.).

## ScreenHandler holds mutable state; Terminal delegates

`ScreenHandler` owns `Buffer` (mutable in place), `Cursor` / `Sgr` /
`Mode` (immutable values, reassigned on update), and `?string $windowTitle`.
`Terminal::feed()` drives bytes through the Parser; accessors delegate
to the handler. `Terminal::__clone()` deep-clones the handler so that
`withCursor()` / `withMode()` etc. don't share mutable state with the
original instance — without that, mutating one Terminal's cursor
would silently affect every Terminal cloned from it.

## SGR sub-handlers are stateless

`SgrHandler::apply($params, $current)` and
`CursorHandler::apply($final, $params, $cursor, $buffer)` take state
as input and return the new state. ScreenHandler owns the only stateful
copy; sub-handlers are reusable across handlers and tests. New CSI
final-byte routes (erase, scroll, mode, OSC) should follow the same
shape so they unit-test in isolation.

## Auto-wrap is deferred; scroll lives in ScrollHandler (PR4)

`ScreenHandler::printChar()` still clamps the cursor at the right edge
rather than auto-wrapping — that lands once we have DECSTBM scroll
margins. Vertical scroll IS in PR4: `LF` (and `IND`, `NEL`, `ESC D`,
`ESC E`) at the bottom row scroll the buffer up by one and keep the
cursor at the bottom. `RI` / `ESC M` at the top scroll the buffer
down. Scrolled-off rows are dropped; scrollback comes later.

## EraseHandler erases to empty cells, not background-colored

`CSI K`, `CSI J`, `CSI X`, `CSI P`, `CSI @` all replace cells with
`Cell::empty()` regardless of the current SGR pen. Real-world
"background-color erase" (BCE) — where the erased region inherits the
current background — can land later if a TUI relies on it; charm's
default vt has the same simple behavior so this matches upstream.

## Mode field ↔ DEC private mode mapping (PR5)

`Mode`'s field names predate the DEC mode numbering and don't align
1:1. The canonical mapping `ModeHandler` uses:

| DEC mode | Mode field         | Notes                              |
|----------|--------------------|------------------------------------|
| 25       | `cursorVisible`    | also mirrored on `Cursor::visible` |
| 1000     | `mouseAny`         | X11 button-only                    |
| 1002     | `mouseCellMotion`  | button + drag motion               |
| 1003     | `mouseExtended`    | any motion (button or not)         |
| 1006     | `mouseSgr`         | SGR coordinate format              |
| 1049     | `altScreen`        | + buffer/cursor/sgr swap           |
| 2004     | `bracketedPaste`   |                                    |
| 2026     | `syncUpdate`       | toggle only — no actual buffering  |

`Mode::$mouseHighlights` is reserved for 1001 (highlight tracking)
but no handler currently sets it. Don't read it as "highlights mode is
on"; read it as "1001 was sent to ModeHandler if/when wired."

## Alt-screen swap (DEC 1049) is held on ScreenHandler

Entering alt mode saves the current `Buffer`/`Cursor`/`Sgr` into
`ScreenHandler` private fields and replaces the active buffer with a
fresh blank one. Leaving restores them. Mutations on the alt buffer
don't bleed to the saved main state (it's a different `Buffer`
instance). Re-entering while already in alt mode is a no-op so it
won't clobber alt content; leaving without entering is a no-op too.

Resize while in alt mode currently resizes only the active (alt)
buffer; the saved main buffer keeps its old dimensions. Real terminals
typically resize both — revisit if a downstream TUI exercises this.

## OSC dispatch lives in OscHandler; ScreenHandler holds the slots (PR6)

`OscHandler::apply($data, ScreenHandler)` parses the OSC payload (the
text between `ESC ]` and the terminator) and writes into specific
public slots on the handler:

| OSC cmd  | Slot                              |
|----------|-----------------------------------|
| 0/1/2    | `windowTitle`                     |
| 4        | `palette[idx]` (`array<int, Color>`) |
| 8        | `currentHyperlink`                |
| 52       | `clipboardEvents[]` log            |

Unknown OSC commands and malformed payloads silently no-op — matches
xterm behavior. Read responses for OSC 52 (`?` payload) are recorded
as `kind=read` events; the parser doesn't synthesize the reply, so a
real PTY consumer needs to walk `Terminal::clipboardEvents()` and
emit a response itself.

## Hyperlink span attribution

`OscHandler` flips `ScreenHandler::$currentHyperlink` between a
`Hyperlink` instance and `null`. Every `printChar()` while non-null
attaches that exact reference to the new `Cell`. Cells written before
the hyperlink opened keep their previous hyperlink (typically null);
cells written after it closes get null again. There's no "hyperlink
ranges" structure — attribution is per-cell.

OSC 8 form is `OSC 8 ; params ; URI`. An empty URI (`OSC 8;;`) closes
the link. The `id=` param is parsed out of `params` if present;
other key=value pairs (separated by `:`) are ignored for now.

## OSC 4 color spec parsing

xterm's `rgb:RRRR/GGGG/BBBB` form allows 1-4 hex digits per component;
they're MSB-aligned. `OscHandler::scaleHexComponent()` scales to 8
bits by either left-padding (1 digit → high nibble) or right-shifting
to keep the most-significant byte. We also accept the CSS-style
`#RRGGBB` shorthand. Other formats (named colors, hsl, etc.) are
rejected — the entry is silently dropped.

## Wide-character handling

CJK and emoji graphemes occupy 2 cells. The second cell is marked with
`Cell::continuation()`. Width queries delegate to `SugarCraft\Core\Util\Width`
to stay consistent with the rest of the stack.

## Stream writes

Never `ftruncate; rewind;` between writes — slice deltas with
`ftell` / `fseek` / `stream_get_contents`.

## Fixture encoding

Fixtures must be LF-only (`\n`). Add `*.ansi binary` to `.gitattributes`
to prevent CRLF normalization on checkout.
