 * runtime quantization from a single TrueColor value. Mirrors
 * lipgloss v2's `CompleteColor`.
 *
 * Use with {@see Style::foregroundComplete()} /
 * {@see Style::backgroundComplete()}; the live {@see ColorProfile}
 * (whatever was set on the Style via `colorProfile()`) picks one of
 * the three colours at render time.
 *
 * For terminals reporting `Ascii` / `NoTty`, the ANSI fallback is
 * returned but `Style::buildContentSgr()` will skip emission anyway
 * since SGR isn't supported.
