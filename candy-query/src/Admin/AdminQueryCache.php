/**
 * Process-level coordinator bridging the synchronous render path to the
 * asynchronous ReactPHP query layer for the admin panel.
 *
 * Admin pages render synchronously in view(), but their data must come from
 * non-blocking queries so a slow `sys.*` report never freezes the event loop.
 * Providers read results from here (via {@see CachedConnection}); a cache miss
 * is recorded as "pending" and returns null instead of blocking. App's admin
 * tick drains the pending set, runs those queries on the React event loop, and
 * stores the rows back — so the next render shows data without ever blocking.
 *
 * Entries carry a timestamp and are re-requested once stale, giving periodic
 * live refresh (process list, replica status) without hammering the server:
 * a single in-flight fetch at a time is enforced by App's adminLoading gate.
 *
 * This is a deliberate process-global: App is rebuilt immutably on every
 * update(), so the live cache cannot live on the model. Call reset() in tests.
