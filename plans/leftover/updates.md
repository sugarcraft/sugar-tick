# updates — running notebook across subagents

This file is the shared work-tracker for every subagent in the
leftover-updates rollout. Append-only during a session; the supervisor
prunes stale items between phases.

Sections below are headings every subagent looks for. Leave the
headings present even when empty so nobody has to invent them.

---

## Blockers

(Items that stop the current step until resolved. The supervisor checks
this before spawning the next subagent.)

_none yet_

---

## Carry-forward

(Items discovered during a step that should be tackled later — usually
in a follow-up step or a deferred phase. Each entry: one short line +
the step that surfaced it.)

- sugar-bits, sugar-charts, sugar-dash, candy-sprinkles, candy-vt need path-repo entries for local sugarcraft/* deps to work without GitHub network access (step 01.02)

## Cross-phase observations

(Patterns or surprises that span phases — e.g. "every i18n step needs
to add a path-repo entry for sugar-wishlist". Put one-liners here so
later steps don't rediscover.)

_none yet_

## Done log

(One line per completed real step. Helps the supervisor and any
late-joining session see what already shipped.)
