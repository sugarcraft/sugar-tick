 * Sentinel that asks the runtime to suspend the program (Ctrl-Z /

 * SIGTSTP on the process group with the default handler, and on
 * SIGCONT re-arms its handlers, restores the alt screen / raw mode,
 * and dispatches a {@see ResumeMsg} to the model.
 *
 * Mirrors Bubble Tea's `tea.SuspendMsg`. Models typically don't
 * inspect this directly — they emit `Cmd::suspend()` to request a
 * suspend, and react to `ResumeMsg` to refresh state on return.
