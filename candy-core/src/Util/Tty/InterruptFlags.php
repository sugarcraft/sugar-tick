/**
 * Cross-platform process-shared interrupt flag.
 *
 * This class manages a single byte in a shared-memory segment that
 * can be written by a native C callback (on Windows via FFI) and read
 * by the PHP main loop.  Using `shmop` keeps the read/write path free
 * of any Zend VM heap operations — the C callback never touches PHP
 * strings, arrays, or reference counts.
 *
 * ## Platform behaviour
 *
 * - **Linux / macOS**: uses `shmop_open()` with key `ftok(__FILE__, 1)`.
 *   Multiple processes with the same key see the same segment.
 * - **Windows**: uses `shmop_open()` with a fixed namespaced string key.
 *   Windows maps this to a named shared-memory object via the POSIX shmop
 *   shim that PHP's `ext-shmop` provides on Windows.
 *
 * ## Safety contract
 *
 * The writer (C callback) MUST only write a single byte (`"\x01"`) to
 * the segment and return immediately.  No PHP allocations, no string
 * concat, no array operations — those are all unsafe from a non-main
 * OS thread inside the Zend VM.
 *
 * @internal for use by WindowsBackend only
