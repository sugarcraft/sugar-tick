# CandyMouse

Self-contained Mark/Scan/Get mouse hit-testing (bubblezone pattern) plus `ZoneClickTracker` for press/release deduplication. No external Manager wiring needed.

```
composer require sugarcraft/candy-mouse: dev-master
```

## Role

Replaces the model where consumers wire `candy-zone`'s `Manager` externally. Each consumer owns its own `Scanner` instance — click handling stays local, no shared global state.

## Quickstart

```php
use SugarCraft\Mouse\Mark;
use SugarCraft\Mouse\Scanner;
use SugarCraft\Mouse\ZoneClickTracker;
use SugarCraft\Mouse\MouseEvent;

// 1. Wrap interactive content with invisible zone markers.
$rendered = Mark::zone('btn-ok', '  OK  ')
              . Mark::zone('btn-cancel', 'Cancel');

// 2. Scan after rendering to populate the zone registry.
$scanner = Scanner::new()->scan($rendered);

// 3. Reverse-lookup on mouse events.
$zone = $scanner->hit($mouseX, $mouseY); // ?Zone

// 4. Deduplicate clicks so each press+release pair emits one click.
$tracker = new ZoneClickTracker();
$result = $tracker->track(new MouseEvent(5, 1, 0, MouseAction::Release));
if ($result !== null) {
    echo "Clicked zone: " . $result->zone->id;
}
```

## Key classes

| Class | Role |
|---|---|
| `Mark` | Wrap content with invisible Unicode sentinel markers |
| `Scanner` | Parse sentinels; `get(id)` and `hit(col, row)` lookups |
| `Zone` | Readonly bounding box (start/end col/row) |
| `ZoneClickTracker` | Press+Release dedup per button |
| `MouseEvent` | Immutable event (x, y, button, action enum) |
| `MouseAction` | `Press` / `Release` / `Drag` / `Scroll` enum |

## Sentinel design

Sentinels use private-use codepoints U+E000 (open) and U+E001 (close) — they never collide with ANSI SGR sequences or regular text. Scanning strips them from output.

## Multi-row zones

A zone spanning multiple rows (e.g. `"line1\nline2"`) is stored as the **smallest axis-aligned bounding box** that contains all marked cells.  The `inBounds()` check uses this rectangle, so an interior cell that was never part of the original content may still report as inside the zone.  Callers wrapping reflowed or indented text should be aware that the hit-test is approximate for multi-line content.

## Upstream

Inspired by [lrstanley/bubblezone](https://github.com/lrstanley/bubblezone) — the Mark/Scan/Get pattern mirrors bubblezone's API. `ZoneClickTracker` addresses [bubblezone issue #10](https://github.com/lrstanley/bubblezone/issues/10).
